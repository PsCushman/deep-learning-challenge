## Data Preprocessing

*What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?*

The 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from application_df is the target variable. In other words, we are trying to predict whether the money was used effectively.
 
*What variable(s) are the features for your model?*

The feature variables we used are:

AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

*What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?*

The "EIN" and "NAME" columns are identification columns that provide unique identifiers for each organization. However, in this case, they have no impact on the target variable and can be dropped without affecting the model's accuracy.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

*How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?*

In my first neural network model, I used a two-layer architecture with a specific choice for the number of neurons, layers, and activation functions. I chose two ReLu activtion to introduce non-linearity shapes and allow the model to learn complex relationships between the input features and the target variable.

Additionally, I used a single neuron in the output layer (units=1) with a sigmoid activation function (activation="sigmoid") to model the binary classification problem. The sigmoid activation function maps the output to a range between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the positive class.

In summary, the model architecture with the chosen number of neurons, layers, and activation functions attempt to balance complexity and simplicity, allowing the model to learn and generalize well on the given classification task.

*Were you able to achieve the target model performance?*

NO! I was only able to achieve 73%. The target model performance which was 75%.


*What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?*

Well... 

## Increasing Neurons and Epochs

![Screen Shot 2023-08-09 at 9 00 46 AM](https://github.com/PsCushman/deep-learning-challenge/assets/122395437/05b2d022-488f-438e-a427-ad96a577bb08)


By increasing the number of neurons in a layer, the model becomes more expressive and can capture complex patterns in the data. This allows for better representation of the underlying relationships between the features and the target variable, potentially leading to higher accuracy.

Increasing the number of epochs gives the model more opportunities to learn from the data and adjust the weights. It allows the model to refine its predictions and find better parameter values, which can lead to improved accuracy. However, it's important to find a balance as increasing epochs excessively can lead to overfitting.

While increasing the number of neurons increased the speed at which the model got to around 73% accuracy, it did not improve the model. As for increasing the epochs, I increased them all the way to 500 without any success improving the model's performance.

In fact, I added neurons to multiple models, but any more than the amount I chose did not increase the model's performance on the test data. While the accuracy did improve on the training model, it tended to overfit the data if I increased them much higher. 

I chose 50 epoch to avoid anymore overfitting and because after a certain amount of epoch, it wasn't doing much to improve the model.

So while, it increased the speed, increasing nodes and epochs did not get me over the 75% accuracy threshold.

## Adding Layers

Adding more layers can provide the model with additional capacity to capture and represent intricate relationships within the data. Each layer can learn different levels of abstraction, enabling the model to extract more meaningful features and potentially improving accuracy. Deep models with multiple layers can learn hierarchical representations of the data, which can be advantageous for complex problems.

I had the same results with 2,3, and 4 hidden layers. Increasing the layers over 2 hidden layers did not increase the model's performance by much at all, still topping off at around 73%. While there were times when the accuracy of the training data improved, it resulted in an overfitted model that did not produce great results for the test data.

## Adjusting Activation Functions

Introducing a different activation function, such as tanh, can affect how the model interprets and transforms the inputs. Different activation functions have different properties and can capture different types of non-linearities. I used tanh, ReLu, and sigmoid in any number of combinations, but with little success. In the end, starting with a ReLu activation and additional ReLu layer, finishing with an output layer sigmoid, achieved my best results.

With all that, I was still only able to achieve 73 or less%

## Checking Feature Importance

I tried a different algorithm, Random Forest, to get some insights into the importance of different features. Random Forest features importance based on how effectively each feature contributes to the overall prediction. This analysis can help identify the key predictor columns, allowing you to focus on the most informative features and potentially improve accuracy.

Analyzing feature importance helps determine which attributes have the most significant impact on the output. By identifying and selecting the most important attributes, you can reduce the noise and complexity in the model. Focusing on the most relevant features can enhance the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns and improve accuracy.

I tried using the top 3, top 10, and top 25 most important features, but I never got a model that was better than 73%. In the end, using all the features provided the best model for getting the best results. However, I did get a score that was only 2 percentage points off the best model by using only 10 features.

## Attempting Resampling 

In an attempt to address class imbalance in the dataset, I applied resampling techniques to balance the class distribution. Resampling involves adjusting the number of samples in each class to mitigate the effects of imbalanced data. Specifically, we used the RandomOverSampler from the imbalanced-learn library to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.

While the intention behind resampling was to improve the model's performance, the results did not show the desired improvement. Despite the balanced class distribution achieved through resampling, the model's performance metrics such as accuracy and loss did not exhibit the expected enhancement.

## Utilizing PCA

Since feature importance did not provide any relief, I turned to a PCA model. Similar results. Using PCA with 10 elements with the same combinations of activations, neurons and epochs with which I had greatest success, did not improve my results.

The PCA model only achieved 72% accuracy and so another door was closed.

## Turning to the Automated Optimiser

![Screen Shot 2023-08-09 at 1 44 10 PM](https://github.com/PsCushman/deep-learning-challenge/assets/122395437/d53db0ae-af4c-438e-b47d-3228227fa38c)

The Keras Automated Optimiser, like other hyperparameter tuners, systematically explores various combinations of hyperparameters, such as activation functions, number of layers, number of neurons, and epochs. This exploration was supposed to give me all the answers and save me by identifying the most optimal combination of hyperparameters. Instead of manually trying out anymore combinations, I turned to the optimiser to leverage its search algorithms to find the best configuration.


However, I found that for the data I provided for the tuner, no model could cross the 75% accuracy threshold. And so, I was stuck at 73%.

# Conclusion


Conclusion: An Exhaustive Effort to Improve Model Performance

A wide-ranging effort was made to enhance the performance of my neural network model for this binary classification task. The initial model architecture was a two-layer network with two hidden ReLU activations, which aimed to strike a balance between complexity and simplicity, enabling effective learning and generalization.

Despite thoughtful and comprehensive design choices, the target model performance of 75% accuracy was not reached. Several strategies were employed to achieve this goal, but none resulted in the desired outcome.

*For example...*

Increasing Neurons and Epochs: Adding more neurons and epochs to capture complex patterns and allow the model to refine its predictions did not yield substantial improvements. The model plateaued at around 73% accuracy despite these adjustments.

Adding Layers: Experimenting with deeper architectures by adding more hidden layers did not lead to significant improvements. The model's performance remained around the same level.

Adjusting Activation Functions: Trying different activation functions like tanh, ReLU, and sigmoid, both individually and in combinations, did not produce better results than the original ReLU activation.

Feature Importance Analysis: Exploring feature importance through methods like Random Forest did not result in feature selections that led to a substantial increase in accuracy.

Resampling Techniques: Applying resampling techniques to address class imbalance did not lead to the desired enhancement in model performance, as the accuracy remained around 73%.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Implementing PCA with various configurations and activation functions did not yield the desired improvement, with accuracy remaining at 72%.

Automated Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizing an automated optimizer to systematically search for optimal hyperparameters also did not result in surpassing the 73% accuracy barrier.

The culmination of these efforts demonstrates the complexity of the problem and the challenges in achieving substantial improvements in model performance. The inability to breach the 75% accuracy target suggests that other factors, such as inherent complexity in the data, feature quality, or limitations in the dataset size, might be contributing to the stagnation in model performance.

In conclusion, the analysis highlights that model improvement is a multifaceted process that involves a deep understanding of the problem, the dataset, and the interactions between various model components. Despite exhaustive exploration and experimentation, the elusive 75% accuracy threshold was not reached, underscoring the inherent complexity of certain machine learning tasks and the need for careful consideration in model design, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering.
